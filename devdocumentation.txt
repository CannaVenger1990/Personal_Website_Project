Notes on development cycle -

* March 21st, started building HTML code and created sections of Home Page. Linked Blog page and Contact page to Nav element. Committed new changes to Github to backup work done so far.

* March 22nd, working on implementing Bootstrap framework. Researching which way I want to use Bootstrap (import URL or download locally).

* March 23rd, working more on implementing Bootstrap and using the grid layout. Adding the nav-bar element and reading the docs on bootstrap for layout and positioning. 

* March 25th, got the basic layout of the homepage done, need to work on styling and the other pages that will be linked to the homepage. Also drew a site map by hand and a basic layout on paper to help me get things organized and where I want them. Need to add a footer next, and also can't forget to add Twitter and YouTube to Contact Me dropdown. Taking a break at 3:00pm to get some fresh air for a little bit. Been in front of my computer for a few hours and need to rest my eyes.
