Notes on development cycle -

* March 21st, started building HTML code and created sections of Home Page. Linked Blog page and Contact page to Nav element. Committed new changes to Github to backup work done so far.

* March 22nd, working on implementing Bootstrap framework. Researching which way I want to use Bootstrap (import URL or download locally).

* March 23rd, working more on implementing Bootstrap and using the grid layout. Adding the nav-bar element and reading the docs on bootstrap for layout and positioning. 

* March 25th, got the basic layout of the homepage done, need to work on styling and the other pages that will be linked to the homepage. Also drew a site map by hand and a basic layout on paper to help me get things organized and where I want them. Need to add a footer next, and also can't forget to add Twitter and YouTube to Contact Me dropdown. Taking a break at 3:00pm to get some fresh air for a little bit. Been in front of my computer for a few hours and need to rest my eyes.

* April 25th, haven't been able to do a whole lot on my project with everything happening with the virus. Today I am jumping back in researching how to implement the Twitter API into my website. Ended up getting the Twitter API working today, and now I need to get the content and stuff to be responsive so I can have it look right. Also need to finish my social media links. Study more about what to implement with React.

* April 26th, working on getting the layout right on index2.html file. The widget is working correctly, but it is not behaving as it should for mobile first, and when it is expanded for a larger screen, it is not jumping to the ride side on the viewport as it should.
