# Personal_Website_Project
Project to develop a website for my personal and professional needs as well as a blog.

# My Project Plan Name
The Bored Man Blog

## Project Summary
My project will be a display of what I have learned throughout the Code Louisville program in the form of a professional website to advertise/hone my skills I have learned. I will show implementation of multiple front-end languages, as well as the use of Twitter API (Possibly Facebook), and interactive elements through JavaScript, and I will be using the BootStrap framework.

## Technical summary
I will be using Front-End languages to develop my project, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan on using the Twitter API to pull my Twitter feed into my website, and I plan to use the BootStrap Framework as well as React to add interactive elements.

## Features
* Home page, this will include information about myself and education as well as a Twitter feed.
* Blog page, this will be a page where I will update my blog and add posts for things I am studying or share information about things that interest me.
* Contact Me page, this will have a list with link to my social media accounts as well as my email information. 
* I will implement a hamburger style drop down menu while using a mobile first development style, and when displayed on larger screens it will extend across the top of the page, and will auto hide with scrolling. I also plan to implement a sticky footer with some general information and links
* I plan to implement React to possibly do some interactivity with photos and links on the page

## Milestones
